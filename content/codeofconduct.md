DC541 sets out to provide a forum for open discussion between participants.  Radical viewpoints are welcome, and skepticism is expected.  Under these auspices, however, insulting or harassing other participants is unacceptable. At its core DC541 is to be seen as a productive environment for everyone, therefore we take individual participants safety to be a large part of this productivity.

It's not about what you look like but what's in your mind and how you present yourself that counts.

We do not condone harassment against of any participant or spectator, for any reason. Harassment includes deliberate intimidation and targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. The Archons reserve the right to respond to harassment in the manner we deem appropriate, including but not limited to expulsion from the organization and referral to the relevant authorities.

This Code of Conduct applies to everyone: all members of DC541, spectators, visitors, guests and the Archons.

Anyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact an Archon.
