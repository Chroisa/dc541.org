DC541 is a Eugene, Oregon-based <a href="https://defcongroups.org" class="link underline white hover-orange">DEF CON Group</a>. Our goal is to provide a community for individuals to explore the intended and unintended uses of technology. We welcome people of all skill levels and backgrounds. We believe our group will benefit from diversity of thought and experience. We encourage members to talk about the things that interest them, and work together to accomplish individual as well as group goals. Whether through presentation, demonstration, or conversation the hope is that we can learn from and motivate each other.
